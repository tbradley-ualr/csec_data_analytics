# Project 3: Vulnerability Data Mining

## Introduction

In this project you will extract data from the National Vulnerability Database and store this in your MongoDB database.

## Instructions
> Open GitHub Desktop and pull changes for the project. Use these updates to copy into your existing ongoing project.

1. **Obtain your National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API Key**: 
   - Navigate to [Request Your NVD API Key](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key).
   - Fill out the form, accept the terms of service, and validate your email to receive an API Key

2. **Develop a Vulnerability Model**: 
   - Develop a MongoEngine model for vulnerability data. The model must include the following fields:
     - CVE ID
     - Vulnerability description
     - CPE Configurations
     - CWEs
     - All CVSS attributes
   - Each distinct vulnerability will be a single document.

3. **Extract a Year of NVD Vulnerability Data**: 
   - Develop a utility class to connect to the NVD API and extract a year's worth of CVE data. Extract and store the 
   data into MongoDB through your MongoEngine model.
   - Create a manage command that imports and calls your utility function (e.g. `csec_data_analytics_app/management/commands/mine_nvd.py`)

4. **Update Exploitability Metrics**:
   - Create a new function to mine data from the Department of Homeland Security's CISA website of 
   [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json)
   - Update the CVE records having known exploited vulnerabilities with the correct metric for exploitability
5. **Test Queries**: 
   - Develop the following MongoEngine queries to answer the following questions:
     - How many vulnerabilities did Google Chrome have last year?
     - How many vulnerabilities had an attack vector of 'NETWORK'? How many had an attack vector of 'PHYSICAL'?
     - Which vendor had the highest number of known exploits last year?
     - What was the most common weakness last year?

## Submission Requirements

### **Assignment Documentation**

---

#### 1. Code Documentation (40 points)

a. MongoEngine Model Design (10 points)
- Provide a comprehensive MongoEngine model outlining the structure of your vulnerability object.

b. Data Mining Utility Class (15 points)
- Design and document a utility class responsible for extracting data from:
  - The National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
  - CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities

c. Data Queries (15 points)
- Present the specific queries you developed for step 5

---

#### 2. Query Execution Results (20 points)

a. API Methods Walkthrough (10 points)
- Offer a concise walkthrough that demonstrates the successful execution of each API method. 
- For enhanced clarity and visualization, include screenshots at appropriate stages.

b. Query Outcomes (10 points)

---

#### 3. Reflection and Understanding (40 points)

a. Vulnerability Search in Organizations (10 points): Discuss how an organization that manages thousands of software 
products might utilize the NVD to identify relevant vulnerabilities.

b. Challenges in Using the NVD (10 points): Highlight potential challenges an organization might face when relying on 
the NVD for vulnerability discovery.

c. Vulnerability Data Analysis (10 points): Conduct an analysis of a year's vulnerability data. Subsequently, provide 
a summary detailing the most prevalent types of vulnerabilities and hypothesize reasons for their common occurrence.

d. Threat Intelligence Data Accessibility (10 points): Contemplate and hypothesize why threat intelligence data might 
not be as openly available or accessible as vulnerability data.
